# DOOMExtract

A C# command-line tool for extracting DOOM 2016 resources.

Compiled releases can be found [here](https://github.com/emoose/DOOMExtract/releases).

As of 1.5 extracting has been re-vamped to use much less memory, however repacking hasn't been tested yet. (and also needs a cvar changed to allow for modified files IIRC)

If you have any issues please make a report on the [issues page](https://github.com/emoose/DOOMExtract/issues).
